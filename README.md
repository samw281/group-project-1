# Group Project 1

## Description 

One stop shop for activities and accommodations. A single site that can be used by locals and travelers to find something to do and a place to stay in any city they are in or going to. Designed to be simple and easy to use so that anyone can make use of it with no frustration.
The motivation is to cut down on annoyances by designing a simple and easy to use site. It takes care of at least two major considerations when traveling. "What are we going to do?!" and "Where are we going to stay?!" Anyone who has traveled or looked for events to attend knows the struggle of searching through endless sites with a variety of aggravations from sign ups to payments or popups. We changed that system! And made it easier! 

You area able to use our site to look up events, search for hotels in the area, and even find the weather! We used things like Tailwind, Font Awesome, Cloud flare to make things more dynamic and interesting.  Our site is easy to use and mobile responsive.  And jam packed with great pictures to motivate you to take advantage of what you see.  All you do is click, buy, and ENJOY! 

This project was able to bring together individuals that are currently at different speeds in the Boot Camp, to collaborate based upon each individual's strengths.  And though that may seem 'easy peezy' at first glance, it was proved to be challenging from time to time.  We struggled with merging our schedules, our ideas, and even API's.  You will see when clicking on the hotel link its unresponsive.  We faced many challenges trying to make the hotel API work.  At last minute we had to scratch the idea and move forward with the a weather tab.  Though it was disappointing, we understood as a group what was necessary to meet the MVP qualifications and we all agreed to postpone.  

In the future we hope to have the hotel tab up and running, as well as possibly collaborating with another group to bring together a "where to eat" tab to showcase best places to eat in the area!
