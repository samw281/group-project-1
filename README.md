# Group Project 1

## Purpose

This is a group project in which we were tasked to collaboratively use the skills we have learned over the past 6 weeks to create a front end application. Requirements for this project included:

1. Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

2. Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

3. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

4. Use at least two server-side APIs.

5. Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

6. Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

7. Be responsive.

8. Have a polished UI.

9. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

10. Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
